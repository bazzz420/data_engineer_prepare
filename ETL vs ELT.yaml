## Availability of data in the system
- ETL only transforms and loads the data that is required while requirement is gathered .
  Incase of requiremnt miss some data has to be repulled to the datawarehouse on next release.
- ELT alrady has most of the data into the same datalake system .
  Incase of requirement miss it can easily be pulled into the recent dataset.
## Geneated columns
- Complex transformations needed to be added for in fly dataset.
- As most of the ELT is SQL basis , it's easy to generate a calculated column / generated column out of it.
## Compliance
- There might be scenario while you need to mask/ avoid source data with sensitive information.
- ELT solution has to take care of the potential risk of data compliance in the system. Best approach to use ETL in such cases .
## Data size and complex transformation
- ETL is good for medium to smaller dataset with huge transformation
- ELT is good when the volume is huge.
## Data ready to analysis
- The data will be gone through multiple transformtion in ETL.
  Thus it takes time to get the data in ETL but since most of transformtion is already done , it's almost ready to use .
- Data will be available quicker in ETL but since the data is not cleansed , it needs cleaning before processing .
